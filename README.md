A compiler for ChocoPy.

The main goal is to (nearly) fully implement ChocoPy as defined in the language
reference.

# Additional goals

- Multiple backends (native, LLVM)
- Using Hindley-Milner type inference to make all type annotations optional
- Good error reporting
- More features?

# TODO

Lexical structure:

- String literals
- Comments

Syntax:

- Control-flow statements (if, while, for)
- Type annotations
- Blocks
- Functions
- Classes

Type rules:

- Everything

Operational semantics:

- Everything
